# Lines starting with a 'dash' (#) or completely empty are ignored

# C_MAXPWM defines the maximum PWM value allowed when controlling the  
# cooling fans.  
# Only modifications to the numeric values are allowed!  
C_MAXPWM=145

# C_MAXPOINTS defines the total number of points needed to create  
# the controlling curve.  
# Only modifications to the numeric values are allowed!  
# (at the moment only curves with C_MAXPOINTS=5 are supported,  
# changing the value will trigger an error.)  
C_MAXPOINTS=5

# Curve points definition in the format XX:YY:ZZ where:  
# XX is the point number from 1 to C_MAXPOINTS (0 is ignored)  
# YY is the TEMPERATURE value at the XX point  
# ZZ is the PWM set-point value at the XX point  
# Strictly respect the format (whitespace and tab are not allowed)  
# Only modifications to the numeric values YY and ZZ are allowed!

# the last ZZ value (145 in this case) must be equal to C_MAXPWM defined above
